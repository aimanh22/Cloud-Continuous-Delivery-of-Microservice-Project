The Dockerfile helps place all the in place to containerize the app.

## Step 3 Creation of Build System File

This fiile is created to help build the system from scratch. It 

## Step 4 Connecting Repo to CodeBuild

This Github Repo is then 

## Step 5 Running the App




The App is then containerized using the docker command as in the buildspec.yml.
