# Cloud-Continuous-Delivery-of-Microservice-Project
This Repository has been created for the course IDS 721 Cloud Computing at Scale Individual Project 1. This project illustrates how to create a microservice using Flask, containerize it and deploy it using AWS CodeBuild and AWS AppRunner (Infrastructure as Code).

## Step 1 Creation of a Flask App 

An App has been created in Python to accomplish two tasks:
### (i) Get the Abstract of a Topic on Wikipedia

### (ii) Summarize the Abstract of a Topic on Wikipedia in 10 sentences

## Step 2 Containerize it

The App is then containerized using the docker command as in the buildspec.yml.
